## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

### Issues Identified:
❌ Numeric columns imported as text (apostrophe prefix)  
❌ Revenue column with double decimals (e.g., "4803.43.00")  
❌ Google Sheets auto-converting revenue to duration format  

### Cleaning Steps Applied:

| Issue | Fix | Method |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Numbers as text | Re-imported CSV with auto-convert disabled | Import settings: "Convert text to numbers" unchecked |
| Revenue column | Converted text to numeric values | `=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(cell;".00";""))` formula |
| Decimal formatting | Standardized to 2 decimals | Format → Number → 2 decimal places |

**Result**: Clean dataset with 1,800 campaigns, all numeric columns ready for analysis.

## Analysis 1: Platform Performance

### ROAS by Platform

![ROAS by Platform](Images/_ROAS%20by%20Platform.png)

**Key Finding**: TikTok Ads ROAS 7.62 vs Google Ads 3.47

| Platform | ROAS | CTR | CPC | CPA | Budget % |
|----------|------|-----|-----|-----|----------|
| **TikTok Ads** | **7.62** | 5.0% | €1.01 | €29.20 | 24% |
| **Meta Ads** | 5.66 | 2.0% | €1.32 | €39.10 | 19% |
| **Google Ads** | 3.47 | 4.0% | €2.16 | €64.06 | 57% |

### Budget Allocation Misalignment

![Budget vs ROAS](Images/Budget%20Allocation%20vs%20ROAS%20—%20Misalignment.png)

**Critical Problem**: Budget inversely correlated with performance
- Google Ads: 57% budget, ROAS 3.47 (worst)
- TikTok Ads: 24% budget, ROAS 7.62 (best)

**This is backward allocation** — investing heavily in worst performer!

### Recommendations

**1. Reallocate Budget: Shift €2.4M from Google Ads to TikTok Ads**
- Current TikTok: €2.65M × 7.62 = €20.2M revenue
- Proposed TikTok: €5.05M × 7.62 = €38.5M revenue (+€18.3M)
- Reduced Google: €3.95M × 3.47 = €13.7M revenue (-€8.3M)
- **Net gain: +€10M annual revenue**

**2. Google Ads Audit**: Investigate why CPA is 2x higher (€64 vs €29 TikTok)
- Review keyword targeting, landing pages, bidding strategy
- Quality Score analysis
- Conversion funnel optimization

**3. Scale TikTok**: Increase campaigns from 450 to 800+ (currently underutilized)

## Analysis 2: Industry Profitability

### ROAS by Industry

![Industry ROAS](Images/ROAS%20by%20Industry%20—%20Balanced%20Performance.png)

### Key Finding: Well-Balanced Performance Across Industries

Unlike platform performance (where TikTok outperformed Google 2:1), industry performance is remarkably balanced:

| Industry | ROAS | Budget % | Total Spend | Total Revenue |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| SaaS | 5.04 | 21.22% | €2,357,562 | €11,891,991 |
| EdTech | 5.03 | 20.68% | €2,296,979 | €11,549,934 |
| E-commerce | 5.01 | 17.32% | €1,923,987 | €9,637,280 |
| Healthcare | 4.84 | 20.33% | €2,258,684 | €10,930,814 |
| Fintech | 4.48 | 20.45% | €2,271,538 | €10,173,311 |

**Comparison with Platform Analysis**:
- **Platform variance**: 4.15 points (TikTok 7.62 vs Google 3.47) — 119% spread
- **Industry variance**: 0.56 points (SaaS 5.04 vs Fintech 4.48) — 12% spread

**Industry is NOT the primary performance driver** — platform choice (TikTok vs Google) has far greater impact on ROI.

### Recommendation: Maintain Current Industry Allocation

Industry budget allocation is **already optimized** with minimal room for improvement.

**Focus optimization efforts on platform mix** (shift Google → TikTok) rather than industry rebalancing.

**Minor adjustment**: Increase E-commerce budget by +2% (+€200k) given strong ROAS (5.01) and current under-investment (17.32%).

---

## Analysis 3: Campaign Type Efficiency

### ROAS by Campaign Type

![Campaign Type ROAS](Images/ROAS%20by%20Campaign%20type%20—%20Balanced%20Performance.png)

### Key Finding: Balanced Performance, Search Slightly Ahead

All campaign types deliver strong ROAS (4.58-5.31 range):

| Campaign Type | ROAS | CTR | CPA | Budget % |
|---------------|------|-----|-----|----------|
| **Search** | **5.31** | 3.94% | €44.30 | 25.82% |
| Display | 4.84 | 3.81% | €45.85 | 23.81% |
| Video | 4.77 | 3.76% | €48.36 | 25.17% |
| Shopping | 4.58 | 3.85% | €48.00 | 25.20% |

**Budget allocation already optimized** — Search (top performer) receives highest share (25.82%).

**Comparison**:
- Campaign Type variance: 0.73 (16% spread)
- Platform variance: 4.15 (119% spread)

**Conclusion**: Campaign Type is NOT a major performance driver compared to Platform choice.

### Recommendation

**Minor adjustment**: Increase Search budget by +2% (25.82% → 28%)
- Source: Reduce Shopping by -2% (25.20% → 23%)
- Expected impact: +€500k revenue

**However**: Focus remains on **platform optimization** (Google → TikTok shift), which yields **20x greater ROI** than campaign type rebalancing.

### Budget Allocation Misalignment

![Budget vs ROAS Geographic](Images/Budget%20Allocation%20vs%20ROAS.png)

**Budget Misalignment**:
- **India**: ROAS 5.50 (best), receives only 12.95% budget (LOWEST!)
- **USA**: ROAS 4.16 (worst), receives 15.55% budget (HIGHEST!)

India delivers **32% better ROAS** than USA yet receives **2.6% less budget**.

### Recommendations

**1. Rebalance India ↔ USA**:
- Increase India budget: 12.95% → 15.5% (+€283k)
- Decrease USA budget: 15.55% → 13.0% (-€283k)
- **Expected impact**: +€400-600k annual revenue

**2. Investigate USA underperformance** (ROAS 4.16, 24% below average)
- Audit platform mix, audience targeting, campaign quality
- Higher competition/saturation in USA market?

**3. Test India scalability** — gradual budget increase with ROAS monitoring

## Analysis 5: Platform × Campaign Type Matrix

### ROAS Heatmap

![Platform × Campaign Matrix](Images/ROAS%20x%20platform%20x%20campaign%20type.png)

### Key Finding: TikTok Dominates Across ALL Campaign Types

**ROAS Matrix**:

|  | Display | Search | Shopping | Video |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **TikTok** | 8.01 | **8.12** | 7.56 | 7.62 |
| **Meta** | 5.82 | 5.78 | 5.51 | 5.66 |
| **Google** | 3.16 | 3.92 | 3.53 | 3.47 |

**Winning Combination**: TikTok Search (ROAS 8.12)  
**Losing Combination**: Google Display (ROAS 3.16)

### Critical Insight: Platform Choice Matters MORE Than Campaign Type

**TikTok's worst campaign (Shopping 7.56) outperforms Google's best campaign (Search 3.92).**

**Performance variance**:
- **Within-platform variance**: 6-7% (campaign type doesn't matter much)
- **Between-platform variance**: 107% (platform choice is critical!)

**Pattern**: TikTok outperforms Google across ALL campaign types — no campaign type can save Google's poor performance.

### Recommendations

**1. Shift all Search budget**: Google → TikTok
- Google Search (3.92) → TikTok Search (8.12)
- Expected impact: +€3.7M revenue

**2. Cut Google Display entirely**: Reallocate to TikTok Display
- Google Display (3.16) worst overall → TikTok Display (8.01)
- Expected impact: +€1.9M revenue

**3. Maintain Meta Ads**: Consistent mid-tier performance (5.5-5.8) across all types

**Total incremental impact**: +€5.6M revenue through campaign-level reallocation.

| **Meta** | 6.52 | 5.27 | 6.56 | 5.85 | 6.03 | 5.12 | 4.88 |
| **TikTok** | **8.75** | 8.52 | 7.10 | 7.80 | 7.06 | 7.61 | 6.53 |

**Best Combination**: TikTok Australia (ROAS 8.75) 🏆  
**Worst Combination**: Google USA (ROAS 2.97) 🔴

### Critical Insights

**1. USA Underperforms Universally**
- **Google USA**: 2.97 (worst overall)
- **Meta USA**: 4.88 (worst Meta market)
- **TikTok USA**: 6.53 (worst TikTok market)

**USA is the lowest-performing market across ALL platforms** — not platform-specific issue but market-level problem.

**2. Australia/Canada = Hidden Opportunities**
- **TikTok Australia**: 8.75 (highest ROAS in entire dataset!)
- **TikTok Canada**: 8.52 (2nd highest)
- Currently **underinvested** (14% budget each)

**3. India Advantage is Platform-Specific**
- **Google India**: 3.82 (best Google country, but still below 4.0)
- **TikTok India**: 7.80 (3rd best, not highest as expected)
- India's overall strong performance (5.50) driven by **low CPC** (€1.52), not superior conversion quality

### Recommendations

- **Google USA**: -80% (ROAS 2.97 unacceptable)
- **Meta USA**: -30% (ROAS 4.88 below average)
- **TikTok USA**: -20% (ROAS 6.53, lowest TikTok market)

**2. Scale Australia/Canada** (+€800k):
- **TikTok Australia**: +€500k (ROAS 8.75)
- **TikTok Canada**: +€300k (ROAS 8.52)

**3. Investigate USA Market Issues**:
- Universal underperformance suggests **market saturation** or **audience quality issues**
- Consider **exiting USA market for Google entirely** (ROAS 2.97)

**Expected Impact**: +€5M annual revenue through geographic precision allocation.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Platform Choice is the Primary Performance Driver

**Evidence across all analyses**:
- Platform variance (119%) >>> Industry variance (12%), Campaign Type variance (16%), Geographic variance (32%)
- TikTok's worst combination (Shopping in USA: 6.53) > Google's best combination (Search in India: 3.92)
- Pattern holds across ALL dimensions: countries, industries, campaign types, months

**Implication**: **WHERE you advertise (platform) matters far more than WHAT you advertise (industry/campaign type) or TO WHOM (geography).**

### 2. Budget Allocation is Inversely Correlated with Performance

**Misalignments identified**:
- **Platform**: Google 57% budget (ROAS 3.47) vs TikTok 24% budget (ROAS 7.62)
- **Geography**: USA 15.55% budget (ROAS 4.16) vs India 12.95% budget (ROAS 5.50)
- **Platform × Country**: Google USA receives high budget (ROAS 2.97) while TikTok Australia underinvested (ROAS 8.75)

**Root cause**: Budget decisions likely based on **historical inertia** (Google = established player) rather than **current performance data**.

### 3. TikTok is in Growth Phase with Seasonal Peaks

**Growth trajectory**:
- YoY growth: +38% (Jan 6.61 → Nov 9.12)
- High volatility (6.61-9.12 range) = active optimization
- Q4 seasonal lift: +20% in November (Black Friday effect)

**Unlike Google/Meta**:
- Google: Flat, no trend (2.81-4.17 stagnant)
- Meta: Stable, no Q4 lift

**Strategic implication**: TikTok performance is **improving over time** while Google stagnates — early-mover advantage opportunity.
